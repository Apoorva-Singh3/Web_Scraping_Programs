# Different methods of web scraping using Python

## Comparison of Methods
Here's a comparison table summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each method:
| Methods | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests + BeautifulSoup | Simple and easy to use | Limited JavaScript support |
| Selenium | Handles JavaScript-heavy sites, browser automation | Slower, requires WebDriver installation |
| Scrapy | Powerful and scalable, built-in handling of requests and items | Steeper learning curve, more complex setup |
| Requests-HTML | Supports JavaScript rendering, easy-to-use API | Less efficient for large-scale scraping |
| Pyppeteer | Full control over headless browsers, JavaScript support | Requires async code, slower than Scrapy for simple tasks |
| Lxml | Fast and efficient parsing, supports XPath | Limited to static content, requires well-formed HTML |
